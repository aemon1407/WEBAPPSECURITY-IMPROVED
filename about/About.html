        <h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>

            PEMBINA pays special attention to developing the identity of Islamic youth with a comprehensive and authentic Islamic agenda through da'wah and tarbiah as well as strategically designed ideas in preparing youth and students to hone their leadership and be able to face various challenges in the present

        <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
        <p>Persatuan Belia Islam Nasional (PEMBINA) IIUM Chapter is
            A dakwah-based-society that provides various programs to improve students' softskills and intellectual as well as idealism and spiritual. The year 2007 has shown another shift highlighted by PEMBINA. In accordance with its status as a youth NGO, PEMBINA has been officially registered with the Registrar of Youth Organizations (ROY). This registration was completed in a ceremony organized by the Ministry of Youth and Sports to recognize youth associations that have been registered with ROY.
            PEMBINA members themselves need to be more courageous in appearing as young people in voicing their views on youth issues. The National Islamic Youth Seminar held at Sepang Technical School is the first national program that PEMBINA has implemented and is the starting point for 300 PEMBINA members to boost activism in their respective branches.
            Another important event in the history of PEMBINA is the signing ceremony of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) moderated by the President of PEMBINA, Dr. Kamil Azmi Tohiran and Ustaz Abdullah Zaik, ISMA on February 13, 2010. The content of the MoU is to strengthen the education of PEMBINA members through ISMA channels as a strategic partner to carry out education activities. This proves that PEMBINA is so committed to producing 
            youth activists who have a true understanding of Islam and are more integrated in carrying the Islamic agenda among the youth.
