## Brief Description
Web application development is not just about applying business logic and automation of a business flow. It is more on providing a secure service to its users and ensure its availability when it is needed. In any web application development, the most common concerns are input validation, authentication, authorization, XSS and CSRF prevention, and enforcing database and file securities. Thus, for web application security group project we are required to enhance our previous web application development from Web Technologies (INFO 2302) and apply all the security elements or components that we have learned in class to ensure the previous developed web application is hardened with the required security elements or components.
